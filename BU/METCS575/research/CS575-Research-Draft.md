CPU Scheduling Algos w/ CFS and EEVDF

## Project Requirements

- 1000-1500 words
- At least 2 diagrams or illustrations
- Title, Abstract, Introduction, Main Contents, Conclusion, and References

### Presentation Requirements

- The research paper is required to be presented using slides and video presentation.

- Video consists of about a 5-7 minutes, presenting your project from the slides.
- Slides shall be submitted on Blackboard as PDF.
- Video shall be uploaded to Google Drive and set as PUBLIC with a link.
- Research project discussion will be during the final class as part of our research discussion & presentation.

## Paper Outline

### Abstract

- Give overview of paper
  - Will look at algo implementations compare both + benchmarks

### Introduction

- First introduce cpu scheduling
- introduce both eevdf and cfs
- end with paper outline

### Main Contents

- CFS
  - Algo Overview
    - vruntime, red-blacktree
- EEVDF
  - Algo Overview
    - lag, virtual deadline
- Comparison of EEVDF and CFS
  - CFS no explicit way of addressing latency, EEVDF does, EEVDF preferred in Linux
  - show benchmark results

### Conclusion + References

- Summarize research, point out EEVDF overtaking CFS in new kernels, etc.
