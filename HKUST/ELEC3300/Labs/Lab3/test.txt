K2 -> GPIO P13

Draw Dot Question:
- column max is 240, so no issues here
- page max is 320, so if page is greater than 255, 8 bit value cannot be represented so we need to set the first write data to 1 then subtract 256 from it or get the first 8 bits (starting from LSB)
- eg. if page = 320, then writedata for last command is 64 or hex it is page = 0x140 so write data is 0x40

Character Question:
- dotmatrixtool.com to generate matrix,  using 24x24 pixels, row major, little endian
- data array has 72 8 bit hex values, each bit in the value represents a pixel, 3 values represents a row
