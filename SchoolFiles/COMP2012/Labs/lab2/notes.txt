In a shallow copy, object B points to object A's location in memory. Same memory location
This works well if none of the variables of the object are defined in the heap section of memory.
Since both objects will reference to the same memory location, then change made by one will reflect those change in another object as well. 
Creates dangling pointer (pointers that do not point to a valid object)

In deep copy, all things in object A's memory location get copied to object B's memory location.
DeepCopy' points to a different location in memory, but the contents are the same.


Since we are using dynamic memory allocation, deep copy is needed.
